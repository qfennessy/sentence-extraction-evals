You will extract structured information about family members and relationships from a sentence. Your primary task is to identify ALL information in the sentence - every person, relationship, and biographical detail must be extracted with complete accuracy.

# ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR SPECIFIC CASES

## Enhanced extraction of military information

When extracting military service information, pay special attention to these fields:
- event (e.g., "World War II")
- time_period (e.g., "1942-1945")
- award (e.g., "Purple Heart")
- injury_location (e.g., "Normandy")

Example: In "My great-grandfather fought in World War II from 1942-1945 and received a Purple Heart after being wounded at Normandy."
- The "event" field should be: "World War II"
- The "time_period" field should be: "1942-1945"
- The "award" field should be: "Purple Heart"
- The "injury_location" field should be: "Normandy"


## Handling complex temporal references

When extracting temporal information, ensure you properly identify:
- Specific time periods with start and end dates (e.g., "from 1942-1945")
- Duration of events or activities (e.g., "for 35 years")
- Sequential events with temporal markers (e.g., "before retiring in 2018")

Example: When a sentence like "worked in Chicago for 35 years before retiring in 2018" appears, capture both the duration ("35 years") and the significant event year ("2018").


## Education domain information extraction

When extracting education information, carefully identify:
- Institution names (e.g., "Stanford University", "Technical College of Denver")
- Degree types (e.g., "Bachelor's degree", "Ph.D.", "associate's degree", "certificate")
- Fields of study (e.g., "Computer Science", "Biology", "Early Childhood Education")
- Academic achievements (e.g., "valedictorian", "summa cum laude", "thesis with distinction")
- Teaching positions (e.g., "professor", "adjunct instructor", "department chair")
- Specializations (e.g., "educational psychology", "curriculum development")
- Academic metrics (e.g., "4.0 GPA", "top 5% of class", "scored 99th percentile")
- Publication statistics (e.g., "published 35 papers", "h-index of 28", "5 textbooks")
- Student impact (e.g., "taught over 3,000 students", "mentored 25 doctoral candidates")
- Research funding (e.g., "secured $1.5 million grant", "manages $500,000 annual research budget")
- Program outcomes (e.g., "95% job placement rate", "doubled enrollment in 3 years")

Example: In "My sister Emma graduated with a Master's in Educational Psychology from UCLA in 2018 and now teaches special education at Lincoln Elementary School."
- The "education_milestone" field should be: "UCLA"
- The "degree" field should be: "Educational Psychology"
- The "graduation_year" field should be: "2018"
- The "occupation" field should be: "special education teacher"
- The "workplace" field should be: "Lincoln Elementary School"


## Medical information extraction

When extracting medical information, carefully identify:
- Specific conditions and diagnoses (e.g., "type 2 diabetes", "depression", "rheumatoid arthritis")
- Treatment approaches (e.g., "surgery", "physical therapy", "counseling")
- Medical specialties (e.g., "oncology", "pediatrics", "orthopedics")
- Medical roles (e.g., "surgeon", "registered nurse", "medical researcher")
- Research areas (e.g., "infectious disease research", "cancer treatment")

- Treatment durations (e.g., "6 months of chemotherapy", "8 weeks of physical therapy")
- Patient statistics (e.g., "treated over 1,000 patients", "conducted 500 surgeries")

Example: In "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, underwent chemotherapy at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and has been cancer-free since her successful surgery in 2016."
- The "medical_condition" field should be: "breast cancer"
- The "diagnosis_year" field should be: "2015"
- The "medical_care" field should be: "chemotherapy, surgery"
- The "hospital" field should be: "Memorial Sloan Kettering"
- Add "recovery_year": "2016"


## Agricultural information extraction

When extracting agricultural information, carefully identify:
- Farm types (e.g., "dairy farm", "vineyard", "organic vegetable farm")
- Crop specializations (e.g., "wheat", "soybeans", "heirloom tomatoes")
- Farming practices (e.g., "sustainable farming", "crop rotation", "hydroponics")
- Agricultural roles (e.g., "vintner", "farm manager", "agricultural scientist")
- Land details (e.g., "10 acres", "family homestead", "communal farming project")

- The "business" field should be: "corn and soybean farm"
- The "business_location" field should be: "Iowa"
- The "business_duration" field should be: "45 years"
- The "business_transfer" field should be: "passed down to cousin"
- Add "farm_size": "300 acres"
- Add "farming_practice_change": "converted part to organic farming"
- Add "farming_practice_change_year": "2018"


## Technology information extraction

When extracting technology information, carefully identify:

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. EXTRACT EVERYTHING: Every detail in the sentence must be represented in your output - no information should be lost
   - When in doubt, include the information in the appropriate field
   - For complex sentences with multiple details, carefully parse every clause

2. Names and Identifiers:
   - For first-person narrators, always use "narrator" as the name
   - For unnamed family members, use descriptive identifiers (e.g., "father", "mother", "grandmother")
   - For deceased family members, still create complete entries
   - ALWAYS extract the correct name when mentioned (e.g., "My brother James" → name is "James")
   - For multiple unnamed people (e.g., "paternal grandparents"), create separate entries for each person with appropriate names

3. Relationship Representation - CRITICAL:
   - FROM PERSPECTIVE: In first-person narratives, accurately represent relationships from the narrator's perspective
   - EXACTLY AS STATED: Use the exact relationship mentioned in the text (e.g., "Maternal great-grandmother" not just "Great-grandmother")
   - FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE: When "grandparents", "parents", etc. are mentioned, create individual entries for each person
   - RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS: Always include all reciprocal relationships (if A is parent to B, B is child to A)
   - COMPOUND RELATIONSHIPS: For relationships like "brother-in-law", capture all relationships accurately
   - AVOID INCORRECT INFERENCES: Don't invert relationships (e.g., if "mother" is mentioned, her relationship is "mother" not "daughter")

4. Biographical Details - CRITICAL:
   - DATES: Extract all years precisely (birth_year, death_year, immigration_year, etc.)
   - MEDICAL: Include all medical conditions, diagnoses, ages of diagnosis, treatments
   - LOCATIONS: Capture all locations (birthplace, deathplace, locations of events)
   - ACHIEVEMENTS: Note all accomplishments, awards, distinctions
   - EDUCATION: Extract educational institutions, degrees, graduation years
   - WORK: Include occupation, workplace, work duration, retirement
   - MILITARY: Note service branches, periods, ranks, awards
   - TRAVEL: Capture immigration details, destinations, vessel names
   - EVENTS: Include historical events, activism, incidents

5. Complex Family Structures:
   - For multiple family members, create entries for ALL individuals mentioned
   - For couples, include both spouses with appropriate relationships
   - For parent-child relationships, connect all relevant individuals
   - For extended families, maintain all relationship connections
   - For adoptive/blended families, represent all relationships accurately

6. Complex Examples That Must Be Handled Correctly:
