You will extract structured information about family members and relationships from a sentence. Your primary task is to identify ALL information in the sentence - every person, relationship, and biographical detail must be extracted with complete accuracy.

Here is the sentence:
{SENTENCE}

Let me work through this step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify all people mentioned in the sentence
- Who are all the individuals explicitly named or described?
- Are there implicit individuals (like "narrator" in first-person sentences)?
- What identifying information is given for each person?

Step 2: Determine each person's relationships
- How is each person related to others mentioned in the sentence?
- What are the reciprocal relationships (if A is B's parent, B is A's child)?
- Are there implied relationships I need to capture?

Step 3: Extract all biographical details for each person
- What personal information is provided (birth/death dates, locations, etc.)?
- What accomplishments, occupations, or milestones are mentioned?
- What numerical information (ages, years, counts) is included?

Step 4: Organize everything into the required JSON structure
- Create entries for each person with complete information
- Ensure all relationships are properly represented
- Double-check that no details from the sentence are missing

Extract all family relationships and biographical details mentioned in the sentence, and output a JSON object with the following structure:

}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. EXTRACT EVERYTHING: Every detail in the sentence must be represented in your output - no information should be lost
   - When in doubt, include the information in the appropriate field
   - For complex sentences with multiple details, carefully parse every clause

2. Names and Identifiers:
   - For first-person narrators, always use "narrator" as the name
   - For unnamed family members, use descriptive identifiers (e.g., "father", "mother", "grandmother")
   - For deceased family members, still create complete entries
   - ALWAYS extract the correct name when mentioned (e.g., "My brother James" â†’ name is "James")
   - For multiple unnamed people (e.g., "paternal grandparents"), create separate entries for each person with appropriate names

3. Relationship Representation - CRITICAL:
   - FROM PERSPECTIVE: In first-person narratives, accurately represent relationships from the narrator's perspective
   - EXACTLY AS STATED: Use the exact relationship mentioned in the text (e.g., "Maternal great-grandmother" not just "Great-grandmother")
   - FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE: When "grandparents", "parents", etc. are mentioned, create individual entries for each person
   - RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS: Always include all reciprocal relationships (if A is parent to B, B is child to A)
   - COMPOUND RELATIONSHIPS: For relationships like "brother-in-law", capture all relationships accurately
   - AVOID INCORRECT INFERENCES: Don't invert relationships (e.g., if "mother" is mentioned, her relationship is "mother" not "daughter")

4. Biographical Details - CRITICAL:
   - DATES: Extract all years precisely (birth_year, death_year, immigration_year, etc.)
   - MEDICAL: Include all medical conditions, diagnoses, ages of diagnosis, treatments
   - LOCATIONS: Capture all locations (birthplace, deathplace, locations of events)
   - ACHIEVEMENTS: Note all accomplishments, awards, distinctions
   - EDUCATION: Extract educational institutions, degrees, graduation years
   - WORK: Include occupation, workplace, work duration, retirement
   - MILITARY: Note service branches, periods, ranks, awards
   - TRAVEL: Capture immigration details, destinations, vessel names
   - EVENTS: Include historical events, activism, incidents

5. Complex Family Structures:
   - For multiple family members, create entries for ALL individuals mentioned
   - For couples, include both spouses with appropriate relationships
   - For parent-child relationships, connect all relevant individuals
   - For extended families, maintain all relationship connections
   - For adoptive/blended families, represent all relationships accurately

6. Complex Examples That Must Be Handled Correctly:
