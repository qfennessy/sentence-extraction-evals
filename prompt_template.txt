You will extract structured information about family members from a sentence. 

Here is the sentence:
{SENTENCE}

Extract all family relationships mentioned in the sentence, and output a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "family_members": [
    {
      "name": "person's name",
      "age": "age if mentioned, otherwise null",
      "gender": "gender if mentioned, otherwise null",
      "occupation": "occupation if mentioned, otherwise null",
      "relation_to": [
        {
          "name": "related person's name",
          "relationship": "how they are related (e.g., 'son', 'daughter', 'brother', 'sister', 'mother', 'father', etc.)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Example:
For the sentence "John's sister Mary is a 30-year-old doctor with two kids", the output would be:
{
  "family_members": [
    {
      "name": "Mary",
      "age": "30",
      "gender": "female",
      "occupation": "doctor",
      "relation_to": [
        {
          "name": "John",
          "relationship": "sister"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "John",
      "age": null,
      "gender": "male",
      "occupation": null,
      "relation_to": [
        {
          "name": "Mary",
          "relationship": "brother"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Only return the JSON object, with no other text.
