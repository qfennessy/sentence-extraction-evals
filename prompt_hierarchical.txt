# CRITICAL GUIDELINES

## 1. CORE EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES
   ### 1.1 Completeness
   - Extract EVERYTHING - every detail in the sentence must be represented in your output
   - When in doubt, include the information in the appropriate field
   - For complex sentences with multiple details, carefully parse every clause
   
   ### 1.2 Accuracy
   - Ensure all extracted information precisely matches what is stated in the text
   - Do not make assumptions beyond what is directly stated or clearly implied
   - Pay special attention to dates, numbers, and proper names

## 2. NAMES AND IDENTIFIERS
   ### 2.1 Person References
   - For first-person narrators, always use "narrator" as the name
   - For unnamed family members, use descriptive identifiers (e.g., "father", "mother", "grandmother")
   - For deceased family members, still create complete entries
   
   ### 2.2 Name Extraction
   - ALWAYS extract the correct name when mentioned (e.g., "My brother James" â†’ name is "James")
   - For multiple unnamed people (e.g., "paternal grandparents"), create separate entries for each person with appropriate names

## 3. RELATIONSHIP REPRESENTATION
   ### 3.1 Perspective
   - FROM PERSPECTIVE: In first-person narratives, accurately represent relationships from the narrator's perspective
   - EXACTLY AS STATED: Use the exact relationship mentioned in the text (e.g., "Maternal great-grandmother" not just "Great-grandmother")
   
   ### 3.2 Multiple Relationships
   - FOR MULTIPLE PEOPLE: When "grandparents", "parents", etc. are mentioned, create individual entries for each person
   - RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIPS: Always include all reciprocal relationships (if A is parent to B, B is child to A)
   - COMPOUND RELATIONSHIPS: For relationships like "brother-in-law", capture all relationships accurately
   
   ### 3.3 Relationship Accuracy
   - AVOID INCORRECT INFERENCES: Don't invert relationships (e.g., if "mother" is mentioned, her relationship is "mother" not "daughter")

## 4. BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS
   ### 4.1 Temporal Information
   - DATES: Extract all years precisely (birth_year, death_year, immigration_year, etc.)
   
   ### 4.2 Medical Information
   - MEDICAL: Include all medical conditions, diagnoses, ages of diagnosis, treatments
   
   ### 4.3 Geographical Information
   - LOCATIONS: Capture all locations (birthplace, deathplace, locations of events)
   
   ### 4.4 Achievement & Education
   - ACHIEVEMENTS: Note all accomplishments, awards, distinctions
   - EDUCATION: Extract educational institutions, degrees, graduation years
   
   ### 4.5 Professional Information
   - WORK: Include occupation, workplace, work duration, retirement
   - MILITARY: Note service branches, periods, ranks, awards
   
   ### 4.6 Additional Context
   - TRAVEL: Capture immigration details, destinations, vessel names
   - EVENTS: Include historical events, activism, incidents

## 5. COMPLEX FAMILY STRUCTURES
   ### 5.1 Multiple Family Members
   - For multiple family members, create entries for ALL individuals mentioned
   - For couples, include both spouses with appropriate relationships
   
   ### 5.2 Relationships Network
   - For parent-child relationships, connect all relevant individuals
   - For extended families, maintain all relationship connections
   - For adoptive/blended families, represent all relationships accurately
