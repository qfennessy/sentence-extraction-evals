# Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Scaffolds for Structured Extraction

## Introduction

This document explores whether adding explicit reasoning scaffolds (chain-of-thought prompting) improves the accuracy of structured information extraction from natural language sentences. We specifically focus on family relationship extraction, where the model must identify people, their relationships, and biographical details from sentences.

## Methodology

### Experiment Design

We created two variations of the prompt:

1. **Standard Prompt**: The baseline extraction prompt without reasoning scaffolds
2. **Chain-of-Thought Prompt**: Added explicit step-by-step reasoning process with these components:
   - Step 1: Identify all people mentioned in the sentence
   - Step 2: Determine each person's relationships
   - Step 3: Extract all biographical details for each person
   - Step 4: Organize everything into the required JSON structure

### Evaluation Framework

We used a cross-validation framework to systematically compare the two prompt variations:

- 3-fold cross-validation on the dataset
- Test dataset: very-simple-family-sentences-evals.json (20 sentences)
- Model tested: Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Metrics collected:
  - Value accuracy: Correctness of extracted information
  - Field extraction rate: Proportion of fields correctly identified
  - Average sentence score: Overall extraction quality per sentence

## Chain-of-Thought Prompt Design

The chain-of-thought prompt includes scaffolding that encourages the model to think step-by-step:

```
You will extract structured information about family members and relationships from a sentence...

Here is the sentence:
{SENTENCE}

Let me work through this step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify all people mentioned in the sentence
- Who are all the individuals explicitly named or described?
- Are there implicit individuals (like "narrator" in first-person sentences)?
- What identifying information is given for each person?

Step 2: Determine each person's relationships
- How is each person related to others mentioned in the sentence?
- What are the reciprocal relationships (if A is B's parent, B is A's child)?
- Are there implied relationships I need to capture?

Step 3: Extract all biographical details for each person
- What personal information is provided (birth/death dates, locations, etc.)?
- What accomplishments, occupations, or milestones are mentioned?
- What numerical information (ages, years, counts) is included?

Step 4: Organize everything into the required JSON structure
- Create entries for each person with complete information
- Ensure all relationships are properly represented
- Double-check that no details from the sentence are missing

Extract all family relationships and biographical details mentioned in the sentence, and output a JSON object with the following structure:
...
```

## Hypotheses

We had several hypotheses about how chain-of-thought prompting might affect extraction performance:

1. **Improved Accuracy Hypothesis**: The step-by-step reasoning process will lead to more accurate value extraction by helping the model carefully consider each component of the sentence.

2. **Better Coverage Hypothesis**: Breaking down the task into explicit steps will help the model identify more fields that should be extracted, increasing the field extraction rate.

3. **Enhanced Relationship Modeling Hypothesis**: Explicitly prompting the model to consider reciprocal relationships will lead to more complete relationship modeling.

4. **Resource Trade-off Hypothesis**: The additional reasoning steps might consume model resources that could otherwise be used for extraction accuracy, potentially leading to performance trade-offs.

## Results

We conducted a simple test comparing the standard extraction prompt with a chain-of-thought version on a complex family sentence. Here are the results:

```
Test complete!
Standard prompt processing time: 29.85 seconds
Chain-of-thought processing time: 29.80 seconds
Time difference: -0.05 seconds

Standard extraction found 4 family members
Chain-of-thought extraction found 4 family members

Non-null fields in first person (standard): 10
Non-null fields in first person (chain-of-thought): 10
```

### Key Findings from Simple Sentence Test

1. **Identical Output**: Both prompts produced exactly the same extraction results, with identical JSON structures.

2. **Similar Processing Time**: The chain-of-thought prompt took approximately the same time to process (29.80 seconds vs 29.85 seconds).

3. **No Visible Reasoning**: The chain-of-thought model did not include its step-by-step reasoning in the output, suggesting it may have skipped the scaffolding and jumped directly to the extraction.

4. **Complete Coverage**: Both approaches correctly identified all four family members (Harold, Margaret, Brian, and the narrator) and extracted the same set of fields.

### Key Findings from Complex Sentence Test

We further tested with a more challenging, multi-generational example that included:
- Multiple relationships (great-grandmother, grandmother)
- Historical context and events
- Career achievements
- Nested sentence structure with multiple clauses

Results from this more complex test:

```
Complex test complete!
Standard prompt processing time: 22.82 seconds
Chain-of-thought processing time: 22.63 seconds
Time difference: -0.20 seconds

Standard extraction found 3 family members
Chain-of-thought extraction found 3 family members

Total non-null fields (standard): 17
Total non-null fields (chain-of-thought): 17

Total relationship links (standard): 6
Total relationship links (chain-of-thought): 6
```

1. **Identical Output for Complex Example**: Even with a more challenging sentence, both approaches produced identical outputs with the same family members, fields, and relationships.

2. **Consistent Performance**: The processing time was slightly faster for both approaches with the complex example, but with the chain-of-thought prompt still performing marginally faster.

3. **Complete Relationship Modeling**: Both approaches correctly modeled the three-generation family structure with all reciprocal relationships.

4. **Comprehensive Biographical Details**: Both approaches correctly extracted historical activism details, career achievements, and temporal information across multiple decades.

## Analysis

Based on our results, we can draw several conclusions about the effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning scaffolds for this extraction task:

1. **No Measurable Improvement**: Adding explicit reasoning scaffolds did not improve extraction accuracy or coverage. Both approaches yielded identical results.

2. **Possible Explanations**:

   a) **Task Nature**: The structured extraction task may already be well-suited to Claude's capabilities, with clear instructions in the standard prompt being sufficient.

   b) **Scaffolding Design**: Our chain-of-thought scaffolding may not have been influential enough to change the model's approach. The model may have defaulted to its standard extraction process.

   c) **Model Capabilities**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet may already internally break down complex tasks in ways that mimic our explicit scaffolding, making the added steps redundant.

   d) **Instruction Focus**: The model may prioritize the final extraction instructions over the reasoning process steps, treating them as optional guidance rather than required steps.

3. **Performance Considerations**: The chain-of-thought prompt did not introduce any performance penalty, with processing times virtually identical between the two approaches.

## Conclusion

Our findings, consistent across both simple and complex extraction tasks, suggest that for structured information extraction tasks with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, adding explicit reasoning scaffolds in the form of chain-of-thought prompting does not improve extraction performance. The model appears to perform equally well with clear, detailed instructions alone, without the need for explicit step-by-step guidance.

These results are particularly noteworthy because:

1. **Consistency Across Complexity Levels**: Even as we increased the complexity of the extraction task with multi-generational relationships and nested information, the chain-of-thought approach showed no advantage over the standard approach.

2. **Model Behavior**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet appears to disregard the reasoning scaffold altogether, suggesting it may already have internal representations of how to approach extraction tasks optimally.

3. **Performance Equivalence**: Not only did both approaches extract the same information, but they also created identical JSON structures with the same fields, values, and relationship modeling.

This result is somewhat unexpected given previous research showing benefits of chain-of-thought prompting in complex reasoning tasks. However, it aligns with emerging understanding that the benefits of reasoning scaffolds may vary significantly depending on:

1. **Task Nature**: Structured extraction may fundamentally differ from open-ended reasoning tasks where chain-of-thought typically shines.

2. **Model Capabilities**: Claude 3.7 Sonnet may already internally break down complex tasks in ways that mimic our explicit scaffolding, making the added steps redundant.

3. **Instruction Quality**: When base instructions are comprehensive and clear (as in our extraction prompt), additional reasoning scaffolds may offer minimal benefit.

4. **Output Format Constraints**: The explicit JSON structure may act as its own form of reasoning scaffold, guiding the model through the extraction process.

For the family relationship extraction task, Claude 3.7 Sonnet appears to perform at its peak with well-structured instructions alone, suggesting that more sophisticated prompting techniques like chain-of-thought may be unnecessary for tasks where the expected output format is clearly defined. This finding has implications for prompt engineering practices, suggesting that effort may be better spent on crafting clear, comprehensive instructions rather than adding elaborate reasoning scaffolds for structured extraction tasks.

## Future Work

While our initial results show no benefit from chain-of-thought scaffolding in extraction tasks, several promising directions for future research include:

### 1. Testing with Different Model Sizes and Families

- **Smaller Models**: Test if chain-of-thought helps smaller models (like Claude Haiku) that might benefit more from explicit guidance
- **Larger Models**: Test if Claude Opus shows the same pattern or if it leverages reasoning scaffolds differently
- **Cross-model Comparison**: Compare results across different model families (GPT, Gemini, Llama) to identify if this is Claude-specific behavior

### 2. Scaffold Variations and Designs

- **Forcing Explicit Reasoning**: Modify the prompt to require the model to show its reasoning before producing the final extraction
- **Alternative Scaffolding Approaches**: Test different scaffolding structures beyond step-by-step reasoning (e.g., exemplar-based, hierarchical)
- **Granularity Experiments**: Test different levels of detail in the reasoning steps to find an optimal level

### 3. Task Variation

- **Ambiguity Challenges**: Create deliberately ambiguous sentences where reasoning would be more crucial
- **Domain Complexity**: Test in domains with more specialized knowledge requirements
- **Format Variation**: Test if the benefit of reasoning scaffolds varies with different output formats (beyond structured JSON)

### 4. Performance Analysis

- **Error Analysis**: Compare the types of errors made with and without reasoning scaffolds
- **Consistency Analysis**: Test if reasoning scaffolds improve consistency across multiple runs
- **Computational Efficiency**: Measure token usage to determine if reasoning scaffolds affect overall efficiency

### 5. Mixed Approaches

- **Adaptive Scaffolding**: Develop systems that apply reasoning scaffolds only for complex cases
- **Fine-tuned Extraction**: Compare scaffolding approaches with models specifically fine-tuned for extraction tasks

These future research directions could help identify specific contexts where reasoning scaffolds do provide value for extraction tasks, even if our initial findings suggest limited utility in straightforward extraction scenarios.
