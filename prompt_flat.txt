You will extract structured information about family members and relationships from a sentence. Your primary task is to identify ALL information in the sentence - every person, relationship, and biographical detail must be extracted with complete accuracy. Here is the sentence: {SENTENCE}.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES: Extract EVERYTHING including all details in the sentence. For first-person narrators, always use "narrator" as the name. For unnamed family members, use descriptive identifiers (e.g., "father", "mother", "grandmother"). For deceased family members, still create complete entries. ALWAYS extract the correct name when mentioned (e.g., "My brother James" â†’ name is "James"). For multiple unnamed people (e.g., "paternal grandparents"), create separate entries for each person with appropriate names. In first-person narratives, accurately represent relationships from the narrator's perspective. Use the exact relationship mentioned in the text (e.g., "Maternal great-grandmother" not just "Great-grandmother"). When "grandparents", "parents", etc. are mentioned, create individual entries for each person. Always include all reciprocal relationships (if A is parent to B, B is child to A). For relationships like "brother-in-law", capture all relationships accurately. Don't invert relationships (e.g., if "mother" is mentioned, her relationship is "mother" not "daughter"). Extract all years precisely (birth_year, death_year, immigration_year, etc.). Include all medical conditions, diagnoses, ages of diagnosis, treatments. Capture all locations (birthplace, deathplace, locations of events). Note all accomplishments, awards, distinctions. Extract educational institutions, degrees, graduation years. Include occupation, workplace, work duration, retirement. Note service branches, periods, ranks, awards. Capture immigration details, destinations, vessel names. Include historical events, activism, incidents. For multiple family members, create entries for ALL individuals mentioned. For couples, include both spouses with appropriate relationships. For parent-child relationships, connect all relevant individuals. For extended families, maintain all relationship connections. For adoptive/blended families, represent all relationships accurately. Only return the JSON object, with no other text.
